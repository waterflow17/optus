## This is project to read from BOM data, filter and display result as json

### Design
- BOM data is from this [URL](http://www.bom.gov.au/fwo/IDN60801/IDN60801.95765.json) 
- It uses Python with Flask web service module to:
  - read the data from bom url (shown above)
  - parse and filter the temperature greater than 10.
  - return the json object
- It uses Docker container to host the python application mentioned above
- It is deployed via Heroku, a platform-as-a-service designed for developers, free for small apps.

### How it is organized
- Dockerfile describe how to build the image
- webapps contains python web service application including test files

### How to deploy and run
- Pre-requirement:
  - Install heroku, git, docker in your development environment. 
- Deploy
  - First create a heroku app
    `$ heroku create`
  - Build the image and push to Container Registry: `$ heroku container:push web`
  - Then release the image to your app: `$ heroku container:release web`
- Run
  - Now open the app in your browser: `heroku open`
  - Note: in the example, the app has already deployed [here](https://calm-inlet-96529.herokuapp.com)

### How to use
- main query, run the default and return information when temperature is greater than 10, with name,
    apparent_t (temperature), lat, lon.
- filter by temperature, by passing `/?apparent_t=15.5`, this will return information when tempeature is greater
    than 15.5 degree. Example link is [here](https://calm-inlet-96529.herokuapp.com/?apparent_t=15.5)
- mimic error response from BOM, by passing `/?createErrorResponse=True`, this will return error message. Exampla    link is [here](https://calm-inlet-96529.herokuapp.com/?createErrorResponse=True)

### Notes
1. Use field 'lon' instead of 'long'
  - One of the requirement is to return field 'long' from BOM response, but I can't find any corresponding
fields. Instead I found 'lon' which is in the json response. 
2. Use user-agent
  - when using programs (either curl, or python web service request) to query BOM server, I got permission denied.
  - This is due to BOM to prevent web scrape practice
  - To get around this issue, I add user-agent in the web request header
3. Use 10 instead of 20 as filtering temperature
  - The requirement is to use 20, but after using it, it will return none records in our current weather.
  - So I use 10 degree instead. 
  - You can filter and pass any degree you want by using  `?apparent_t=20` in the url.
